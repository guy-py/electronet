# USM Test Results Analysis

Based on the ElectroNet project validation data from tests conducted at Universiti Sains Malaysia on **December 15, 2025**.

## Three Types of Analytical Tests

### 1. DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering) - Particle Size & Zeta Potential Analysis

This is the key validation data mentioned in the project. The tests measured two critical parameters:

#### Particle Size Results

- **B01 (Before filtration)**: Average particle size = **1129 nm** (1.1 μm)
- **B04 (After filtration)**: Average particle size = **1657 nm** (1.7 μm)
- **Finding**: Particles increased by **~47%** in size

#### Zeta Potential Results (Surface Charge)

- **B01 (Before filtration)**: Average = **-20.3 mV**
- **B04 (After filtration)**: Average = **-12.7 mV**
- **Finding**: Surface charge reduced by **~37%** (closer to zero)

**Validation**: The electrocoagulation process successfully caused microplastics to aggregate (clump together), creating larger particles with reduced surface charge, making them easier to filter mechanically.

### 2. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)

Files: `.sp` spectral data files and Excel graphs

- Used to identify the chemical composition of the microplastics
- Confirms testing of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) as mentioned in the methodology

### 3. UV-VIS Spectroscopy

Files: `.csv` and `.DSW` data files with graphs

- Measures light absorption/transmission through the water samples
- Can indicate particle concentration and water clarity before/after treatment

## File Organization

- **Raw instrument data**: `.sp`, `.DSW`, `.csv` files
- **Processed results**: `.xlsx` Excel files
- **Visual graphs**: `.numbers` (Mac), `.xlsx` (Windows)
- **Summary PDFs**: Complete test results

## Conclusion

The data strongly supports the electrocoagulation approach for microplastic removal through particle aggregation. The increased particle size and reduced surface charge demonstrate that the ElectroNet system effectively treats PVC microplastics in water.
