# ElectroNet

> A journey to combat microplastic pollution through electrocoagulation technology

This repository documents the development and scientific validation of **ElectroNet**—an electrocoagulation-based microplastic removal system—created by three students from **Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman (STAR)** in collaboration with **Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)**.

## Our Mission

To develop an affordable, scientifically-validated solution that removes microplastic contamination from water systems through particle aggregation, protecting both human health and the environment.

## Project Overview

ElectroNet employs electrocoagulation principles to destabilize and aggregate suspended microplastics in water. By applying controlled electrical potential through graphite electrodes, the system induces:
- **Charge neutralization** of microplastic surfaces
- **Particle aggregation** into larger, filterable clusters
- **Improved separation efficiency** for mechanical filtration

The system demonstrated **47% increase in particle size** and **37% reduction in surface charge** during university laboratory validation, confirming successful microplastic aggregation.

**Target applications:** Water treatment plants, swimming pools, urban water systems, and point-of-use filtration

### Key Achievements
- ✓ University-validated prototype with quantitative results
- ✓ Multi-technique analytical validation (DLS, FTIR, UV-VIS spectroscopy)
- ✓ Collaborative research with USM Engineering Faculty
- ✓ Documented problem-solving (electrode material optimization)

## The Journey

### Scientific Validation at USM
On **December 15, 2025**, our team conducted comprehensive laboratory validation at Universiti Sains Malaysia's Engineering Campus, employing three analytical techniques to characterize the ElectroNet system's performance:

**Analytical Methods:**
1. **Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)** - Particle size distribution and zeta potential measurement
   - Before treatment: 1129 nm particles, -20.3 mV surface charge
   - After treatment: 1657 nm particles, -12.7 mV surface charge
   - **Result:** 47% size increase, 37% charge reduction → successful aggregation confirmed

2. **FTIR Spectroscopy** - Chemical identification of PVC microplastics
   - Molecular fingerprinting to confirm contaminant identity

3. **UV-VIS Spectroscopy** - Water clarity and optical properties assessment
   - Quantitative measure of treatment effectiveness

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Electrode Corrosion Problem:**
- **Initial design:** Steel electrodes
- **Issue:** Significant corrosion during electrocoagulation operation
- **Solution:** Switched to graphite electrodes for superior corrosion resistance
- **Outcome:** Stable operation with minimal degradation

**Multi-Sample Testing Approach:**
Testing was conducted on five water sample types to evaluate system versatility:
1. Sterilized water (control)
2. School pipe water (real-world urban supply)
3. Reverse osmosis water (purified matrix)
4. PVC-contaminated water (primary test sample)
5. Facial cleanser water (cosmetic microplastic contamination)
