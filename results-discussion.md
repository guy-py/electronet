# Results and Discussion

## RESULTS

### Key Performance Metrics (DLS Analysis)

| Parameter | Before (B01) | After (B04) | Change |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Particle Size | 1129 nm | 1657 nm | **+47%** |
| Zeta Potential | -20.3 mV | -12.7 mV | **-37%** |

### Findings

**✓ Successful Microplastic Aggregation**
- 47% size increase → larger, filterable particles formed
- 37% charge reduction → destabilized suspension via charge neutralization
- FTIR confirmed PVC presence; UV-VIS showed improved water clarity

## DISCUSSION

**Mechanism:** Electrocoagulation (9V DC, graphite electrodes, 60 min) neutralized particle surface charge, inducing aggregation through electrostatic attraction.

**Significance:** Larger aggregates (1.7 μm vs 1.1 μm) enable conventional mechanical filtration to capture microplastics effectively.

**Optimization:** Graphite electrodes eliminated corrosion issues from initial steel design while maintaining stable operation.
