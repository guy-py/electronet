# ElectroNet

## Abstract

**ElectroNet is a device to filter microplastics in water using electric fields.** Microplastics in treated and drinking water—about five particles per liter—cause environmental damage by harming ecosystems and entering the food chain. These particles can carry toxic chemicals linked to cancer risks and genetic abnormalities in humans. ElectroNet solves this problem using electrocoagulation. An electromagnetic charge applied to a metal mesh makes microplastics clump together into larger particles, which are then trapped by the filter. It is effective for common microplastics such as PVC and PPE and can run on solar or low-voltage power. The system utilises sensors to remove microplastic pollution and uses IoT connectivity to send water quality alerts. This makes ElectroNet easy to integrate into various water systems in cities, swimming pools, water treatment plants, and sewage facilities to contribute to a cleaner, greener future.

## Problem Statement

Microplastic contamination in water is an urgent threat to both human health and the environment.

Tiny plastic particles cannot be disgested and will increase the risk of inflammation, hormonal imbalance and potentially contribute to cancer when consumed.

Discarded plastic bottles break down into microplastics that pollute rivers, oceans, and soil that harm ecosystems and enter the food chain.

Despite these risks, regulations and monitoring of microplastics in water remain limited, making this a critical issue that needs urgent investigation.

## Commercial Value

This item will be priced at **RM 500**. It is an affordable price for a microplastic filter. Its low-voltage operation, easy installation, and IoT monitoring make it suitable for hotels, cities, and industries. By improving water safety and helping users meet environmental standards, ElectroNet offers strong market potential and long-term cost savings.

## Methodology

1. Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram below.
2. Set the voltage with 9V.
3. Pour sample into the top beaker.
4. Wait until the sample stops flowing.
5. Extract the sample and store in testing tube.
6. Close the testing tube with stopper.
7. Rinse all the apparatus with distilled water.

## Approval from Experts at USM

On the **10th of December 2025**, The ElectroNet team visited the Engineering Campus of USM to analyse PVC samples filtered from our machine. It reduced surface charge and increased the size of the microplastics, allowing better filtration.

### Results:
- **Before filtration** - Higher zeta potential (surface charge)
- **After filtration** - Reduced zeta potential, indicating successful treatment
